I made a JavaScript and HTML5 development documentation project based on the Certiport exam questions. The project includes explanations and examples of important concepts to help learners prepare for the Certiport certification exam or improve their JavaScript programming skills. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this project is a valuable resource for developing your skills in JavaScript and HTML5 development.
